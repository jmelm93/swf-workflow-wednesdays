_You can find the video tutorial for this tool here: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDMLxqcB85Y)._

## Overview

This tool is designed to help with internal link placement strategy. It leverages AI to analyze web pages, generate summaries, and identify optimal linking opportunities within your content.

**Key Features:**

- Scrapes content from a target URL and a list of URLs to link.
- Provides concise summaries of the linked URLs.
- Suggests relevant anchor text and specific link placement locations within the target URL's content.
- Offers updated content with internal links placed strategically.

## How It Works

This Langdlow project is structured with an initial split into two parallel flows that converge for final processing:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B(Target Page Content Scraping);
    A --> C(Linking Targets Analysis);
    B --> D(Data Combination);
    C --> D;
    D --> E(Internal Link Targeting & Placement);
    E --> F[Chat Output];

    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1.  **User Input:** The process begins with a user providing a target URL and a list of URLs to link via the **Chat Input** node.

2.  **Flow 1: Target Page Content Scraping:** This flow focuses on extracting the main content from the target URL. It includes:

    - **Prompt (TargetURLScrapePrompt):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to scrape the content of the target URL.
    - **Tool (FirecrawlScrapeApiTool):** Uses the Firecrawl API to scrape the content from the URLs to link.
    - **Agent (MainContentScrapeAgent):** Uses an LLM to scrape the content of the target URL and output it in markdown format.

3.  **Flow 2: Linking Targets Analysis:** This flow focuses on analyzing the URLs to link and generating summaries. It includes:

    - **Prompt (LinkingTargetsSummarization):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to summarize the content of the URLs to link.
    - **Tool (FirecrawlScrapeApiTool):** Uses the Firecrawl API to scrape the content from the URLs to link.
    - **Agent (Content Summarization Agent):** Uses an LLM to generate concise summaries of the content from the URLs to link.

4.  **Data Combination:** This step combines the outputs from both flows into a single text chunk. It includes:

    - **Combine Text:** Combines the summaries of the linked URLs and the scraped content of the target URL into a single text chunk.

5.  **Internal Link Targeting & Placement:** This step analyzes the combined text to determine the best internal link placements and anchor text. It includes:

    - **ChatModel (InternalLinkTargetingChat):** Uses an LLM to analyze the combined text and determine the best internal link placements and anchor text.
    - **ChatModel (InternalLinkPlacementChat):** Uses an LLM to analyze content to provide updated text for link placement.

6.  **Output Display:** The final step displays the results in a user-friendly format. It includes:
    - **Chat Output:** Displays the results in a user-friendly markdown table format.

## Environment Variables

To use this tool, you need to set the following environment variables in your Langflow instance:

- **`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`**: Your Firecrawl API key. You can obtain one from the Firecrawl website: [https://firecrawl.dev/](https://firecrawl.dev/)
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Your OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from the OpenAI website: [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)

**How to Set Environment Variables:**

1.  After uploading the flow to Langflow, click on the "Settings" icon (usually a gear icon) in the top right corner.
2.  Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
3.  Add the required variables with their corresponding values.

## Input Format

The tool expects the following input format. Make sure to include the `# Source URL:` and `# Target URLs:` headings:

- **Source URL:** The URL of the page where you want to place internal links. Only one source URL should be provided.
- **Target URLs:** A list of URLs that you want to link to from the target URL. You can include as many URLs as you need.

**Example Input:**

```

# Target URL:

- https://www.example.com/target-page

# URLs to Link:

- https://www.example.com/page-1
- https://www.example.com/page-2
- https://www.example.com/page-3

```

## Output Format

The tool will output a markdown table with the following columns:

| Source URL   | Target URL     | Anchor Text     | Link Placement Notes | On-Page Adjustments | Link Placement   |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| [SOURCE_URL] | [TARGET_URL_1] | [ANCHOR_TEXT_1] | [NOTES_1]            | [Yes or No]         | [UPDATED_TEXT_1] |
| [SOURCE_URL] | [TARGET_URL_2] | [ANCHOR_TEXT_2] | [NOTES_2]            | [Yes or No]         | [UPDATED_TEXT_2] |
| ...          | ...            | ...             | ...                  | ...                 | ...              |

... (and so on for all URLs processed)

- **Target URL:** The URL of the page that is being linked to.
- **Anchor Text:** The recommended text to use for the link. If no suitable anchor text is found, this column will be left blank.
- **Link Placement Notes:** Specific instructions on where to place the link within the target URL's content. If no suitable link placement is found, this column will explain why.
- **On-Page Adjustments:** Whether or not the AI had to make any on-page adjustments to strategically place the internal link.
