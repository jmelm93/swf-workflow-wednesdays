# SEO Workflows - AI Workflow Wednesdays Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to the SEO Workflows repository for AI Workflow Wednesdays! Every Wednesday, we're excited to bring you a new AI-powered SEO tool to supercharge your workflows. This repository contains the configuration files you need to test these tools using Langflow.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized by week, with each week's tool residing in its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- **`{week_num}-{flow_name}.json`**: The Langflow configuration file for the specific tool.
- **/prompts directory**: The finalized prompt used in the tool.
- **/custom_code directory**: The custom code used in the tool (if needed).
- **`README.md`**: A detailed guide specific to that tool, including required environment variables and usage instructions.

## Getting Started:

### Setting Up Langflow

To use these tools, you'll need a Langflow instance. Here are a couple of options:

- **Datastax (Free Option):** Datastax offers a free way to host your Langflow instance (as of 12/25/2025). Check it out here: [https://www.datastax.com/products/Langflow](https://www.datastax.com/products/Langflow)
- **Self-Deployment:** You can also deploy your own Langflow instance. We recommend using Render.com, and you can find detailed instructions in the Langflow documentation: [https://docs.Langflow.org/deployment-render](https://docs.Langflow.org/deployment-render)
